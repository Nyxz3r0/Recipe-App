# Recipe-App
Personal recipe app I'm creating to learn app deployment from backend to front end. Going into this, I have had some experience with MySQL and Python in data analysis and visualization cases, but want to expand my skillset.

Tech: Postgre SQL (Supabase), Python, Streamlit

If you have any suggestions for added features or more professional code, please leave a comment! I am mostly teaching myself, so any advice is appreciated.
